> I'm asking myself if i should do more.

- Better `script` and `link`, should not concatenate strings and check if the html is valid (? maybe it's ok);
- Add a `prune-based type` on urls;
- Add a `prune-based custom` value with I/O html and Cheerio for a custom method of pruning/management;
- Add more tests.
