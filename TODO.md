# TODO

> I'm asking myself if i should do more.

- Better `script` and `link`, should not concatenate strings and check if the html is valid (? maybe it's already ok);
- Add a `prune-based type` on urls (not only on `query-parameters`);
- Add a `prune-based custom` value with `I/O html` and `Cheerio` for a custom method of pruning;
- Add more tests.
